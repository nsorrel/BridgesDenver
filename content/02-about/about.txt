Text: ## about Bridges International
***
We are a faith-based, 501c3 nonprofit organization, that has the unique privilege of serving international students in the U.S..

We want you to have an exceptional experience while here. Our goal is to care for all of you...mind, body and spirit. We can help you with everything from airport pick-ups, English assistance, and social opportunities to conversations about life's deepest questions. Bridges International staff and volunteers are dedicated to serving you in an unabridged, holistic way.

Our staff and volunteers have a great deal of cross cultural experience.  Many of us know first hand what it is like to study and live in a foreign land. Students like you arrive with your own unique culture and perspective. We respect those things as we get to know and serve you.

We desire to equip and help you to be a blessing to the world around you. 

Welcome to Denver, Colorado, USA.
