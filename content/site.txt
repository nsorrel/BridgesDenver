Description: Whether you are here or arriving soon, we want to welcome you to Denver! Denver is a beautiful city, full of diversity and opportunity.   We want you to enjoy the best that this city and country have to offer.  From friendships and food, to study and travel, we want your time here to be unforgettable.  
 
Bridges International staff and volunteers are dedicated to serving you in an unabridged, holistic way. We understand the joys and difficulties of cross-cultural living, as many of us have lived and studied abroad, as well. We know you arrive with your own unique culture and perspective.  We respect your individuality, and would love to learn more about you as we help you to understand the unique culture here.
 
As a faith-based nonprofit organization, we want you to have an exceptional experience while here. Our goal is to care for you: mind, body, and spirit. We can serve you through airport pick-ups, English language assistance, host families, travel, fun social activities, and as a friend to wrestle through life’s difficult and deep questions.  
  
We desire to equip and help you to enjoy life and be a blessing to the world around you.

How can we help?
